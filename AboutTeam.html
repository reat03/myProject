                This project is all about working together as a team as a part of our university course. We were given a brief (in short) of "creating a web app using a database system", so we decided upon this game, 'Thief Go!'.
                The game in and of itself is simply a platformer put together with a couple, minor, puzzle solving elements, e.g. flipping a switch etc. There are two main parts to the project:
                <ol>
                    <li>Singleplayer - run entirely client side and linked to your account</li>
                    <li>Multiplayer - using web sockets and rooms, also linked to your account</li>
                </ol>
                Each of us have done a part of the project as will be listed below.
            </p>
            <h2>The Team</h2>
            <h3>Dawei - Level Designer</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="./pageAssets/Dawei.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Dawei"> Dawei has mainly been focused on the level design of the project, trying to make it fun and create interesting designs. His creative designs were integral to the finished product as they allowed the other parts of the project, e.g. the art and mechanics, to take a spotlight to show what we've created.
            </p>
            <h3>Spencer - Multiplayer Lead</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="./pageAssets/Spencer.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Spencer"> Spencer has concentrated his efforts largely on creating the networking and socket logic within the program. Alongside this, he managed to rework the client-side physics in the engine into a server application to allow players to properly interact within the multiplayer setting. This is what allows us to create a multiplayer application and will prove vital to the finished product. 
            </p>
            <h3>Raghad - Artist and Website Developer</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="./pageAssets/Raghad.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Raghad"> Raghad has worked on multiple parts of the project. She has been instrumental on finding art and other resources we have used, as well as creating many herself. On top of this she has created a majority of the website with the login/signup pages and the stylesheet we use.
            </p>
            <h3>Nimmi - Level Designer</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="./pageAssets/Nimmi.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Nimmi"> Nimmi also focused a majority of her time on the level design of the game. Working alongside Dawei, she helped create the engrossing stages for the player to explore and work their way through, whilst avoiding the perils within them. Having 2 people on level design allowed us to create an actually enjoyable game for people to play that would not be over within 5 minutes of starting.
            </p>
            <h3>Ben - Singleplayer Lead</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="./pageAssets/Ben.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Ben"> Ben mainly put his effort into the creation of the client-side game, along with the general testing of physics and the level data format. He used PhaserJS, along with JSON formatting, to create an easily accessible way to create levels through a JSON object template. Ben also did a majority of the audio work for the project.
            </p>
            <h3>Ghayadah - Artist and General Developer</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="./pageAssets/Ghayadah.png" style="vertical-align: middle;" title="Ghayadah"> Ghayadah was the main driving force behind a lot of the more intricate parts of the project, e.g. the level map. These intricate details are what allowed the product to feel finished and polished after the main work was done.
